# Lab 3 Submission

## Path Chosen

I used GitHub Actions.

Reason: this fork is hosted on GitHub, so GitHub Actions is the most direct and simple choice for this repository.

## CI Result

Green CI run:

- Initial green run: https://github.com/smairon/DevOps-Intro/actions/runs/27594868651
- Final green run after fixing the intentional failure: https://github.com/smairon/DevOps-Intro/actions/runs/27634676628

## Proof That the Gate Works

I made one small change in a test on purpose. I changed the expected HTTP status code in `app/handlers_test.go` from `201` to `200`.

Result:

- The `test` check became red.
- The pull request could not be merged.

Evidence:

- Failed run link: https://github.com/smairon/DevOps-Intro/actions/runs/27634247618
- Screenshot of failed run:

- Fix commit that restored the test: https://github.com/smairon/DevOps-Intro/commit/fa9f410889773109b9a324d1234c47aca92b9469

## Branch Protection

I enabled branch protection for `main` in my fork.

Enabled rules:

- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Required checks for Task 1: `vet`, `test`, `lint`

After Task 2, the workflow uses a matrix for `vet` and `test`, so I should update branch protection to require `ci-ok`. This is more stable than requiring matrix job names one by one.

## Design Questions

### a) Why pin the runner version (`ubuntu-24.04`) instead of `ubuntu-latest`? What breaks otherwise?

`ubuntu-latest` can change at any time. After such a change, your pipeline may start using a new OS image with different preinstalled tools, different package versions, or changed behavior. Then a workflow that was green yesterday can fail today without any code change in your project. Pinning `ubuntu-24.04` makes the environment stable and easier to debug.

### b) Why split vet + test + lint into separate units? What would happen with one combined job?

Separate jobs run independently and can run in parallel. This makes feedback faster and clearer. If everything is inside one job, one early failure stops the later steps, so you may not see all problems at once. A combined job is also slower, because `vet`, `test`, and `lint` cannot run at the same time.

### c) GH path: what real attack does SHA pinning prevent? Cite the date + name of the incident from Lecture 3.

SHA pinning protects against a supply chain attack where an action tag is moved to malicious code. A tag like `v4` or even `v4.2.2` is still a moving reference, but a full commit SHA points to one exact immutable commit. Lecture 3 gives the example of the **March 2025 `tj-actions/changed-files` compromise**, where the attacker rewrote tags and leaked secrets from many CI runs.

### d) GH path: what is `permissions:` and what is the principle behind it?

`permissions:` defines what the workflow token is allowed to do in GitHub. For example, `contents: read` lets the workflow read repository contents but not write to the repository. The principle is least privilege: give the workflow only the minimum access it needs, so a bug or compromised action has less power.

### e) GitLab path: what is the difference between a stage and a job? What would `dependencies:` do that `stages:` does not?

A job is one unit of work, such as running tests or linting. A stage is a group of jobs, and stages define the high-level order of execution. For example, all jobs in one stage usually finish before the next stage starts. `dependencies:` is more specific: it tells one job which earlier jobs it should download artifacts from. So `stages:` controls order, while `dependencies:` controls artifact flow between jobs.

## Notes

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

The workflow has:

- Trigger on push to `main`
- Trigger on pull requests to `main`
- Three separate jobs: `vet`, `test`, `lint`
- Pinned runner: `ubuntu-24.04`
- Pinned action SHAs
- Least-privilege `permissions: contents: read`

## Task 2 Optimizations

I applied these optimizations:

- Enabled GitHub Actions caching through `actions/setup-go`
- Used `app/go.mod` as the cache dependency file, because this project has no `go.sum`
- Added a build matrix for `vet` and `test` on Go `1.23.10` and `1.24.0`
- Set `fail-fast: false` for the matrix
- Added a `ci-ok` aggregation job, so branch protection can require one stable check name
- Added path filters, so docs-only changes do not run the pipeline

## Timing Table

| Scenario | Wall-clock |
|----------|------------|
| Baseline (no cache, single Go version, no path filter) | 37 s |
| With cache | 53 s |
| With cache + matrix | 45 s |

## Task 2 Notes

This repository has no third-party Go dependencies. There is no `require` block in `app/go.mod`, and there is no `go.sum` file. Because of that, caching gives only a small benefit here. The Go module cache has almost nothing to store, so most of the total time still comes from runner startup, checkout, and downloading the Go toolchain.

## Task 2 Design Questions

### f) Why cache `go.sum`-keyed inputs and not build outputs?

We cache dependency inputs because they are deterministic. If `go.sum` or, in this repository, `go.mod` does not change, we expect the same dependency set again. Build outputs are less stable because they depend on the OS, architecture, Go version, build flags, and other environment details. Caching inputs is safer and more reusable.

### g) What does `fail-fast: false` change in a matrix run, and when do you actually want `fail-fast: true`?

`fail-fast: false` means one failed matrix job does not stop the others. This is useful when you want the full picture, for example to see whether Go `1.23` fails, Go `1.24` fails, or both fail. `fail-fast: true` is better when extra jobs would only waste time or money after the first failure, and you do not need more diagnostic information.

### h) What is the risk of an attacker writing a cache from a malicious PR that protected branches later read?

The main risk is cache poisoning. An attacker may try to save bad files into a cache and hope that trusted workflows later restore and use them. GitHub reduces this risk with cache scope rules. A cache created by a pull request run is scoped to the pull request merge ref, so the base branch and other pull requests cannot restore it. Still, caches should never contain secrets, and workflows should treat caches as untrusted data.
